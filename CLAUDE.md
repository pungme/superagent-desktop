# Working in this repo

The Mac app. `app/` is the Electron project (main / preload / renderer); the
iOS companion and the relay are separate repos beside this one, so a checkout
of only this repo does not have them.

## Releasing — the version is the trigger, not the push

Pushing to `main` releases nothing on its own. A release starts when
`app/package.json`'s **version** changes:

1. bump `version` in `app/package.json`
2. write `app/notes-<version>.md` — the release script refuses without it
3. commit both and push to `main`

`.github/workflows/release.yml` then builds, signs, notarizes, staples and
publishes on a macOS runner. Proven working since 1.9.1-beta.18; all five
secrets are set (`MAC_CERT_P12_BASE64`, `MAC_CERT_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`,
`APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`).

**The channel is the version, not a branch.** `1.9.1-beta.19` publishes as a
GitHub prerelease — the beta channel, which only clients opted into prereleases
see. A plain `1.9.2` publishes as latest, for everyone. Both come off `main`.

`cd app && npm run release` still does the same thing locally and is the
fallback if CI is broken. Never both for one version: they race for the same
tag (CI skips if the tag already exists). Locally you need
`source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh` for node, and `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"`
for `gh` — without the latter the script stops with "gh is not installed".

Notarization is an Apple round trip of several minutes. The script verifies
rather than trusting exit codes, and stops BEFORE publishing when something is
off, so a failure there has shipped nothing and a re-run is safe.

## Checks

`npm run typecheck`, `npm test` (vitest), `npm run lint`, and
`npx playwright test` for e2e — from `app/`.

Two known e2e failures on a clean tree (`opening the workspace…` and
`@ mentions…`): the smoke suite seeds a project with no conversation, so the
composer never appears. Tracked on the board; not something you broke.

The companion e2e suite needs the relay repo beside this one. Without it the
suite skips itself, which is why CI stays green.
